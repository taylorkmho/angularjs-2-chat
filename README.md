# Angular 2 Chat App
This is a chat web app built using Angular 2 as a front-end framework and Webpack as a module bundler/dev server. It is using [mockapi.io](http://mockapi.io) to host the (you guessed it) API. It was started using the [preboot/angular2-webpack](https://github.com/preboot/angular2-webpack) boilerplate.

# Getting Started
To start run `npm install`.
Then run `npm start`.

There are more npm scripts available, as created by preboot. See [package.json](https://github.com/taylorkmho/angularjs-2-chat/blob/master/package.json#L5-L24) for more details.
